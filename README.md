 ## **Data Source**
 Data was extracted from internal Kashier transaction logs covering period 1/1/2021 to 18/10/2029

## **Executive Summary**

Kashier currently distributes resources equally among three payment products: **Point-of-Sale (POS), Payment Pages (PP), and Payment Requests (PR)**. This report analyzes transaction data to determine which product has the highest revenue potential and should receive more strategic focus.

## **Key Findings**

### **Product Performance Overview**

| Product | Total Transactions | Total Transaction Amount | Total Fees Generated | Avg. Transaction Value | Avg. Fee per Transaction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **POS** | 82k | $520bn | $5,2bn | $6.34M | $63k |
| **PP** | 20,74k | $3T | $66,72bn | $128.62M | $3.21M |
| **PR** | 39,33K | $5,38T | $161.42bn | $136.7M | $4.1M |

### **Key Insights**

1. **Payment Requests (PR) are the highest revenue driver**, generating **$161.42bn in fees** with a strong transaction value.
2. **Payment Pages (PP) also show significant revenue potential**, earning **$66.72M in fees**, despite a lower transaction count.
3. **Point-of-Sale (POS) has the highest number of transactions** but produces **the least revenue per transaction** ($6.34M total fees).

## **Recommendation**

### **Strategic Resource Allocation:**

- **Increase resources for Payment Requests (PR)**: This product has the highest revenue generation potential and should receive more sales, marketing, and operational support.
- **Expand Payment Pages (PP)**: Focus on growing high-value transactions while improving customer acquisition.
- **Reassess Point-of-Sale (POS)**: It serves high transaction volume but generates the least fees. Consider repositioning or refining its fee structure.

## **Expected Outcomes**

- **Higher revenue growth** by prioritizing high-fee-generating products.
- **Increased efficiency** in resource allocation by shifting focus from low-margin products.
- **Improved profitability** through targeted marketing and operational improvements in PR and PP.

## **Next Steps**

- Implement an optimized pricing and sales strategy for PR.
- Develop targeted campaigns for PP to increase transaction volume.
- Conduct further analysis on POS to explore better monetization strategies.

This data-driven approach will enable Kashier to maximize revenue while strategically investing in the highest-potential payment products.
